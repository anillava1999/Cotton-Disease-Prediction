# Cotton-Disease-Prediction

I developed ‚ÄúüåøCotton Plant Disease Prediction & Get Cure App‚Äù using Artificial Intelligence especially Deep learning. As Farmer, I know Farmer can‚Äôt solve Farm‚Äôs complex and even small problems due to lack of perfect education. So as AI enthusiastic I decided to solve this problem using the latest technology like AI.

I just took baby step and start to collect lots of images of cotton crop plants from my farm. To collect accurate data we need expertise in that domain and as a farmer it help me a lot.

Then I decide which algorithm is best to solve this problem and I select as usual you know ‚ÄúConvolution Neural Network‚Äù (CNN). I create my own CNN architecture and it works well on the training and as well as testing dataset.

It gives me more than 98% accuracy on training and validation data set in just 500 epochs. I am trying to increase accuracy with more data and epochs.

After that I have deployed this model on AWS cloud. Please have look
